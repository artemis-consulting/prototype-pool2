Supporting Document for Artemis Consulting's Pool 2 Submission
==============================================================
Section-pool3-Vision
----------------------
The "problem statement" describes the current business scenario that creates the need for this project. We decided on the following "problem statement": “We will produce a usable, mobile-friendly and accessible public website using OpenFDA's APIs for drugs, and win one of the BPAs in the process”.  We also created a concise "vision statement" to ensure that the solution meets the intended product owner’s and users’ goals. This shared "vision statement" also helped to keep our team focused: "To deliver a fast, responsive and intuitive API-driven website using the Drug Labels API, Adverse Events API and Enforcement Actions API that integrates information  for the public and other potential users in a holistic fashion, within the next 6 days".

Section-pool3-Overview
----------------------
Since the original RFP had a due date of 06/26/2015, the team had to place boundaries around the solution by deciding which features and system functions to focus on. Due to time constraints, the decision was made to de-scope the following items and revisit them at future sprints.
 * All ‘food’ elements from our system
 * Off-line browsing (e.g. keep the service in case the FDA APIs are down) 
 * Full-blown load testing
 * Content Delivery Network for static content

### Initial scope
Defining the project scope early on helped the team set stakeholders’ expectations while providing sufficient details and features for the team to focus on.
The team determined that instead of using a single API from OpenFDA, what would really serve the public is a website that consumes all the APIs that OpenFDA offers in one target area. Since the APIs are divided into "Drugs", "Devices" and "Food" with "Drugs" having the most APIs, we decided to build a website that consumed all 3 Drugs-related APIs, and offer the users of the site a chance to see the interconnections betwen drug labels, drug adverse reactions and drug recalls. The interconnection would be from each API's dataset to the other API's dataset using targeted queries. In the end based on user testing with our doctor and lawyer subject matter experts(SMEs), we also decided to add a completely new Drug Manufacturers section on the site, which further interconnected the 3 API datasets together but using derived data from each dataset.
The team also decided to support two navigation paradigms for the 4 data sets: Browse and Search. Users could look at a list of what's available for each data set, or could search for an item of interest in each data set. Once the user found an item, the user would still be able to navigate to the other connected data from each item.
The final list of key features we decided to support were:
* Browse drugs by label
* Search drugs by label
* Browse adverse reactions by frequency
* Search adverse reactions
* Browse drug enforcement actions by state
* Browse adverse reactions by gender
* Submit questions using a “Contact Us” form
* Ensure speed and high performance
* Responsive mobile-friendly design
* Section 508-compliant accessible design

Section-pool3-UCD
-----------------

In most of our current client projects, we use an integrated ‘User-Centered Design’ process  where we strongly encourage end-users to shape how the final system gets developed. For the FDA project, we decided on the following UCD techniques (mainly due to time constraints): user personas, user journeys, usability testing, interviews, expert reviews, and prototypes.

During the story planning meetings, the following prospective users where identified: Public users, doctors, pharmacists, attorneys, FDA SMEs/employees, Federal regulators, Federal Watchdog agencies, state regulators
The discovery phase artifacts are [linked here.](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/tree/master/doc/user-centered-design/1-discovery)

Based on the analyzed interview results, the team ended up with the following personas:
* Novice – public users, concerned parents, students, people in the drug and food industry 
* Professional – doctors, pharmacists, mainly medical professionals
* Specialist – Attorney, policy makers, and maybe bloggers 
* Experts – FDA employees, state regulators, federal watchdogs

Click on the links to see the [initial user personas](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/blob/master/doc/user-centered-design/2-user-personas-and-journeys/18f-personas-draft-6-23-2015.pdf), [final user personas](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/blob/master/doc/user-centered-design/2-user-personas-and-journeys/18f-personas-final-6-23-2015.pdf), [initial user journeys](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/blob/master/doc/user-centered-design/2-user-personas-and-journeys/18f-user-journeys-draft-6-23-2015.pdf) and [final user journeys](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/blob/master/doc/user-centered-design/2-user-personas-and-journeys/18f-user-journeys-final-6-23-2015.pdf).

The team strongly felt that applying the UCD techniques in the sections previously mentioned satisfy Play [1] and [2].

When teams have accurate user data at their disposal, the task of designing simple, intuitive, easy-to-use but powerful, interface becomes much more straight-forward. The key design objective was to make the service user friendly instead of frustrating or confusing. Due to time constraints, the team decided against creating a (more traditional) style guide from scratch but opted to use the Bootswatch Paper theme as the design style guide and pattern library for the website. By using this flexible style guide for design and incorporating accessibility best practices, the team is confident that they have satisfied Play [3], ensuring all prospective users can navigate the service intuitively and can obtain the information they want from the service, in a easy and consistent way. 

Section-pool3-UX-usability-testing 
---------------------------------
### Usability Testing

Agile usability testing was integrated with the design and development process so that we could identify and fix user experience problems before they become baked in and expensive to address. In addition to being fast and inexpensive, agile style user testing is highly flexible; it can be conducted without a dedicated lab, on-site and remotely, in both moderated and un-moderated formats. Due to the quick response time required for this prototype, we were not able to use Artemis' standard usability testing tool called Chalkmark.  To view the results the usability testing conducted on 06/12/15, see below.

Section-pool3-UX-testing
------------------------

Here is an overview of the results from Agile UX testing conducted on 06/12/15.
* The subheads/instructions to be too large (The header should not dominate the page and should be a smaller than the “branding” text in the nav bar. They should appear as informational/instructions).
* The gray paragraph text on a gray background can be hard to read (basic design and 508 issue, perhaps lighten the background color).
* The navigation is little redundant and a bit confusing (the buttons below the search box are repeats of the main nav. They should be combined in a dropdown in the search box. Apply the materials theme to the basic sample below).
* It’s not initially clear what or why I am searching “drugs” (Replace initial text with something like the following:
  Search for current drug related information
  Begin your request for FDA drug related information by entering a search term and choosing a category from the dropdown menu).
* I would like more information about the purpose and use of the web app (Add some text to the home page, something like the following:
   Welcome to the FDA Drug Monitor
  We know you take your health seriously. Having the latest Drug related information and tools at your fingertips is a critical part of you overall health and well-being. The information provided by the FDA Drug Monitor is the latest and most relevant in our database. Use it along with your physicians’ advice to make informed decisions about the drugs you take.
  Please note that the information provided here is for reference only and is not intended as medical advice or diagnosis. Always consult with your physician before making drug related decisions.).

Section-pool3-Agile
-------------------

Artemis Consulting uses agile scrum techniques for all their internal development efforts and for most of our client projects. For our agile projects, sprints are usually 1-2 week in duration but never exceed 3 weeks. In general, the shorter the sprints, the faster feedback we receive from our users and clients. This timely feedback enables the team quickly make the necessary adjustments, avoiding potential long-term and costly rework. For the FDA prototype, we decided on 2 day sprints but chose to add a 4 day sprint to accommodate the unusual nature of this project and weekend work.

* We used the open source Taiga tool for agile project management and defect tracking. Taiga tends to be more ‘lightweight’ for project with relative quick turnarounds and firm deadlines. Additional information on Taiga can be found [here](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/tree/master/doc/agile-process/agile-tool-taiga).
* All our agile artifacts related to Play 4, can be found here -> [Sprints](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/tree/master/doc/agile-process). 
* Our team did fairly extensive user testing with doctors and lawyers. Here are the links to the [User Interview Questions](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/blob/master/doc/user-centered-design/4-user-interviews/User%20Interview%20Questions.pdf), the [user testing feedback and our team's remediation comments from a practising pharmaceutical industry lawyer](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/blob/master/doc/user-centered-design/4-user-interviews/User%20Interview%20Questions-Response1-Pharmaceutical-Company-Lawyer.pdf)  and the [user testing feedback and our team's remediation comments from a practising doctor](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/blob/master/doc/user-centered-design/4-user-interviews/User%20Interview%20Questions-Response2-and-Remediation-Doctor-MD.pdf).


Section-pool3-automated-testing
-------------------------------

### Automated testing and deployments

* For this prototype, the team built a suite of automated tests, which tested the app as well as ensured wide code coverage (>92%). [Pool 2 requirements F, Play 10]
* The Pyunit framework was used for unit testing.  As mentioned earlier, the Pyunit code coverage is currently at >92%. [Pool 2 requirements F, Play 10]
* The team used Selenium WebDriver for automated web testing.  Links to the Selenium testing scripts have already been provided earlier in this document. 
* Jenkins was used as our continuous integration and continuous deployment tool. Upon code commits into GitHub, Jenkins automatically runs the unit test suites. If the unit tests pass, the code is automatically promoted to the testing/integration environment. 
For the purposes of this app, Artemis used a cloud-based Jenkins installation called [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/), and a configuration management tool called [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/). The setup of Jenkins instance on Cloudbees is shown in the following screenshots: [Jenkins Screenshot 1](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/blob/master/deployment/CloudBeesScreenshot1.png), [Jenkins Screenshot 2](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/blob/master/deployment/CloudBeesScreenshot2.png), and [Jenkins Screenshot 3](https://github.com/artemis-consulting/prototype-pool3/blob/master/deployment/CloudBeesScreenshot1.png).

Section-pool3-hosting
---------------------

### Flexible hosting environment 

During Sprint 0, the team performed various user analysis tasks and worked on deploying the hosting environment for both test and production. For the test environment (including continuous integration and continuous deployment), the team picked Pivotal's CloudFoundry service(a.k.a. PWS), and for production, the team chose Amazon Web Services (AWS). Both are flexible infrastructures, where additional resources can be provisioned in real-time to meet user demand. For the prototype’s testing environment, the team decided on using Pivotal Web Services (PWS) CloudFoundry, an open (and agile) platform as a service (PaaS).  The Cloud Foundry platform required minimal setup while still proving rapid deployment and scaling capabilities.  Jenkins on CloudBees was utilized for continuous integration and deployment integrated with Github. A Jenkins job periodically runs unit tests, and if the tests are successful, deploys the latest code from the repository to the CI/CD environment. If the tests are unsuccessful, an email is sent out to the appropriate developer. 

For production, we used Amazon Web Services(AWS) primarily AWS has been around for almost a decade now and offers highly reliable, scalable, and relatively inexpensive cloud hosting services.  The AWS management console is simple and relative straightforward web-based tool. Another driver for using AWS is the government’s interest in migrating parts of their IT infrastructure into the AWS GovCloud. AWS was officially approved for government use in 2013.

### Prototype
* [http://opendatafda-artemis.cfapps.io] or [http://demo.artemisconsultinginc.com](http://opendatafda-artemis.cfapps.io) continuously deployed on [Pivotal CloudFoundry](http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cloud-foundry)
* Note: this development site is not part of the Artemis Consulting RFP submission to GSA/18F, and is not guaranteed to be available during the evaluation period. 

Section-pool3-monitoring
------------------------

### Continuous Monitoring
Using AWS for the production environment provided us additional integration benefits – such as Continuous Monitoring (CM). For this prototype, we installed CloudWatch and ThreatStack, two monitoring services that are built for AWS. CloudWatch provides basic and detailed monitoring services and can monitor resource utilization, application and database performance, log files, and overall system’s health. If time permits, we will try to monitor custom metrics of the prototype via a simple API. The service provides a dashboard with graphs, statistics, and alarms. Threat Stack is a Continuous Security Monitoring service for AWS. It protects cloud instances from intrusions and data loss by continuously monitoring and providing insights into the system.
